# NFL and New York Jets Data Analysis

Welcome to my public repositiory for documentation and code used to make content for [NYJetsAnalytics](https://twitter.com/NYJetsAnalytics). All of my plots are created using R, so you'll need the language installed on your computer before getting started. I use [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) to run scripts, create charts, and design animations.

## Getting Started with nflscrapR

If you're interested in learning more about **nflscrapR** in general, check out the [package documentation](https://github.com/maksimhorowitz/nflscrapR) managed by the incredible **Ron Yurko** ([@Stat_Ron](https://twitter.com/Stat_Ron)) and **Maksim Horowitz** ([@bklynmaks](https://twitter.com/bklynmaks)). 

The nflscrapR account ([@nflscrapR](https://twitter.com/nflscrapR)) is always sharing and retweeting great content to learn from and build on.

### General Tutorials

While I try to make my code as readable and reproducable as possible, sometimes it's best to start with the basics. 

Ben Baldwin ([@benbaldwin](https://twitter.com/benbaldwin)) has an excellent [basic nflscrapR tutorial](https://gist.github.com/guga31bb/5634562c5a2a7b1e9961ac9b6c568701) that covers everything from installing the package to incorporating team logos in plots.

Looking advance your visualizations? How about animiated Win Probaility charts for your team? Lee Sharpe ([@LeeSharpeNFL](https://twitter.com/LeeSharpeNFL)) is a great resource to follow and has built a [great repository](https://github.com/leesharpe/nfldata) for sharing code and tutorials. 

## Additional Help

As you play with publically available code and try to make your own, you'll probably get stuck along the way. Should this happen, you can always try what the pros do: google it. 

If you run into issues with my code, feel free to create an issue here, chances are you're not the only one experiencing it. For general questions, my DMs are open on twitter. Disclaimer: while I love football and analyzing data, this isn't my day job, so I may not respond right away, but I do check in frequently. 

Happy plotting! J-E-T-S JETS JETS JETS.
